# Bank Customer Churns
Analysis on the factors influencing customer churn in the banking industry.

## Bank Customer Data for Customer Churn

### Introduction

Churn, in the context of the banking industry, refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a bank or financial institution. Understanding the factors that influence customer churn is crucial for banks to effectively retain their customers and develop strategies to minimize attrition.

The aim of this project is to analyze bank customer data and uncover the key factors that contribute to customer churn. By examining various attributes such as credit scores, account balances, and salaries, we can identify patterns and correlations that help us understand why customers decide to leave the bank.

### Hypothesis

Our hypothesis suggests that customers with lower credit scores, lower account balances, and lower salaries are more likely to churn from the bank. By exploring the dataset and conducting statistical analyses, we aim to validate or refute this hypothesis, gaining insights into the factors that play a significant role in customer churn.

### Acknowledgements

It is widely recognized that acquiring new customers is considerably more expensive than retaining existing ones. For this reason, it is advantageous for banks to proactively identify the reasons behind customer churn and take appropriate measures to mitigate it. By preventing churn, banks can allocate resources towards developing loyalty programs and retention campaigns that aim to retain as many customers as possible.

This project leverages bank customer data to contribute to the understanding of customer churn in the banking industry, ultimately providing valuable insights for banks and financial institutions in their efforts to improve customer retention strategies.
